In order to make presentations go smooth, you should upload your slides before the presentation day. Your presentations will be at most 10 minutes long per project, followed by a 5 minutes Q&A. 

In your presentation, you should

-introduce your problem briefly, explain the dataset you use briefly. (1-2min)

-describe your solution to the problem (4-5 min)

-give your numerical/visual results together with your insights/conclusions. (3-4 min)
